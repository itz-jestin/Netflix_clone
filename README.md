# Netflix_clone
I created a responsive Netflix clone using only HTML and CSS. This project replicates the front-end interface of Netflix, including a sleek navigation bar, banner section, movie thumbnails, and hover effects. Itâ€™s designed to be visually similar to the original platform, with a focus on layout, positioning, and responsiveness.
